                This CAGE Policy Briefing studies the UK's ‘non-doms’ – individuals who
                are resident in the UK but who claim on their tax return that their permanent
                home (‘domicile’) is abroad. We use de-identified confidential data accessed via
                HMRC to analyse all individuals who have claimed non-dom status between 1997
                and 2018. We show non-doms are globally connected and economically elite: almost
                all were either born abroad or have lived abroad for substantial periods, and their
                incomes are very high. Non-doms are highly likely to work in finance and other ‘City’ 
                jobs. They tend to come from Western Europe, India and the US. Within the UK they 
                largely reside in and around London, although there are sizeable shares in Oxford and 
                Cambridge, working in research and education, and in Aberdeen, working in oil.

                This CAGE Policy Briefing studies alternatives to the
                government’s new Health and Social Care Levy. Using publicly
                accessible tax data from HMRC, we find that removing the current
                National Insurance exemptions for investment income and people
                of pension age would raise £12 billion. This is the same amount
                of revenue as the Government is targeting from its new Levy.
                Equalising National Insurance on higher earnings with the rates
                already paid by lower earners could raise an additional £20
                billion. This would be enough to fund a cut in the main rate of
                NICs by 1.25p, instead of raising these rates, as the government
                is planning. Under this alternative package of reforms, more of
                the revenue would come from London and the South East, and from
                older, wealthier individuals.

                This report presents the final findings of the Wealth Tax
                Commission into whether the UK should have a wealth tax. It
                concludes that if the government chooses to raise taxes in
                response to COVID, it should implement a one-off wealth tax in
                preference to increasing taxes on work or consumption.

                Economists are central to policymaking in the UK, and to
                providing the research that underpins that policymaking. Despite
                having this important role in society, economists are not very
                representative of society, with a well-documented
                under-representation of women in the profession. In this
                briefing note, we examine the ethnic diversity of academic
                economists who provide much of the research that ultimately
                feeds into policymaking. We use data from the Higher Education
                Statistics Agency (HESA) to look at which groups are more or
                less well represented as academic economic researchers. We then
                examine economics students, to understand both the source of
                current under-representation and the prospects for change.
                Finally, we study some of the barriers faced by economics
                students. We are not able to examine diversity among the large
                number of economists who work outside academia, due to a lack of
                data.

                This report introduces the UK Wealth Tax Commission, which will
                evaluate whether a wealth tax for the UK would be desirable and
                deliverable. To do this we have commissioned a series of
                Evidence Papers that will study each of the key issues in
                detail. In this report we set out initial evidence on what has
                been happening to wealth and wealth taxation in the UK. We
                examine the provisional case for a wealth tax, and map some of
                the difficulties in implementing it. Our intention here is not
                to provide the answers, but to illustrate the key issues this
                project will address and set out the path to our final report in
                December, which will contain our conclusions on whether or not
                the UK should have a wealth tax, and if so, how it should be
                designed.

                This CAGE Policy Briefing summarises new research on the taxes
                paid by the UK’s richest individuals, using anonymised data
                collected from the personal tax returns of everyone who received
                over £100,000 in total remuneration (taxable income plus taxable
                capital gains). It shows how tax paid as a share of income or
                total remuneration varies across individuals. It shows effective
                tax rates are much lower than headline rates, regressive at high
                levels of income or remuneration, and vary by up to a factor of
                five across people with the same remuneration. An
                <i>Alternative Minimum Tax</i> of 35% could raise around £11bn,
                equivalent to 2p on the basic rate or 5p on both the higher and
                additional rates.

                This CAGE Policy Briefing summarises new research on the impact
                of capital gains – which are excluded from existing income
                statistics – on measured inequality in the UK. It shows gains
                are highly concentrated, are persistent for a minority, and are
                rising. The richest have a larger share of total resources than
                previously thought, and it has been growing over time.

                Capital gains (the profits from disposing of an asset for more
                than it was worth when you acquired it) are generally excluded
                from analysis of incomes in the UK, despite being a significant
                driver of some people’s lifetime living standards. This
                Resolution Foundation Report looks at what we know about taxable
                capital gains; how our understanding of top income shares
                changes if we include capital gains in our analysis; and whether
                definitions of income used in official statistics should be
                changed or supplemented.

                The future of UK economics is looking predominantly male and
                disproportionately privately educated. This column introduces
                <i>#DiscoverEconomics</i> – a campaign to increase diversity in
                economics led by the Royal Economic Society and with the support
                of a wide range of institutions involved in economic research,
                communication and policymaking, including the Bank of England,
                the Government Economic Service, the Society of Professional
                Economists and many leading research institutions. The campaign
                aims to attract more women, ethnic minority students, and
                students from state schools and colleges to study the subject at
                university.

                Government wants both to reduce carbon emissions and to reduce
                ‘fuel poverty’. Energy prices have risen in part because of a
                multitude of policies aimed at reducing emissions. There are
                also multiple policies aimed at ameliorating these effects.
                Altogether, this leads to a complex policy landscape,
                inefficient pricing and opaque distributional effects.<br />
                In this report, we show the effects of energy price rises over
                the recent past, look at what current policies mean for
                effective carbon prices and their impact on bills, and consider
                the distributional consequences of a more consistent approach to
                carbon pricing, alongside possible changes to the tax and
                benefit system that could mitigate these effects.

                The gender pay gap opens up immediately after graduation, with 
                male graduates earning 5% more than female graduates on average 
                at age 25. Ten years after graduation – before most graduates 
                start having children – the gender pay gap stands at 25%. Most 
                of the initial gap can be explained by university subject choices, 
                with women less likely to study subjects that lead to high-paying 
                jobs: women make up just a third of graduates in economics, the 
                subject with the highest financial returns, and two thirds of 
                graduates in creative arts, the subject with the lowest returns. 
                Subject choice continues contribute to the gender pay gap over 
                time, but its relative importance fades as other factors (like 
                having children and working part-time) come into play.

                Carbon pricing will be one of the most talked about policy
                options at COP26. The idea of carbon pricing is that putting a
                price on the emission of greenhouse gases (GHGs) to reflect the
                social costs of climate change should provide producers and
                consumers with strong incentives to reduce such emissions. In
                this observation, we consider the opportunities and risks from
                introducing carbon taxes in developing countries, with reference
                to Ethiopia and Ghana as case studies.

                In the wake of last summer’s Black Lives Matter protests, many
                have asked themselves what they are doing to tackle racial
                injustice. For economists, one central question is the extent to
                which the profession has examined the causes and consequences of
                racial inequality. This column reports evidence that
                race-related research in economic journals constitutes a far
                lower share than in comparable publications in sociology and
                political science. What’s more, economists over-estimate the
                extent of race-related research done by the profession.
                Understanding why economists produce so little race-related
                research is essential if the discipline is going to be able to
                reform.

                The economics profession – and the current student population
                studying economics – is not representative of society, with
                women, some ethnic minorities, and state school students
                underrepresented. While more than 7% of private school boys
                doing an undergraduate degree were studying economics in
                2018/19, less than 1% of state school girls were. We highlight
                that interventions aimed at changing this picture need to
                consider the choices students make early on in their educational
                career. A Level Economics is a key gateway to further study in
                the subject, but access to and take-up of this qualification
                varies substantially according to a student’s background. As a
                result, improving representation within the economics profession
                in the long-term must include steps to ensure young students
                understand what the subject involves and the opportunities it
                provides, and have the chance to study it before university.

                Top incomes have grown rapidly in recent decades and this growth
                has sparked a debate about rising inequality in Western
                societies. This column combines data from UK tax records with
                new information on migrant status to show that that migrants are
                highly represented at the top of the UK’s income distribution.
                Indeed, migration can account for the majority of top-income
                growth in the past two decades and can help explain why the UK
                has experienced an outsized increase in top incomes.

                The future of UK economics is looking predominantly male and

                <i>#DiscoverEconomics</i> – a campaign to increase diversity in
                economics led by the Royal Economic Society and with the support
                of a wide range of institutions involved in economic research,
                communication and policymaking, including the Bank of England,
                the Government Economic Service, the Society of Professional
                Economists and many leading research institutions. The campaign
                aims to attract more women, ethnic minority students, and
                students from state schools and colleges to study the subject at
                university.
