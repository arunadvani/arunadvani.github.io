                This CAGE Policy Briefing summarises new research on the taxes paid by the UK’s richest individuals, using anonymised data collected from the personal tax returns of everyone who received over £100,000 in total remuneration (taxable income plus taxable capital gains). It shows how tax paid as a share of income or total remuneration varies across individuals. It shows effective tax rates are much lower than headline rates, regressive at high levels of income or remuneration, and vary by up to a factor of five across people with the same remuneration. An <i>Alternative Minimum Tax</i> of 35% could raise around £11bn, equivalent to 2p on the basic rate or 5p on both the higher and additional rates.

                Capital gains (the profits from disposing of an asset for more than it was worth when you acquired it) are generally excluded from analysis of incomes in the UK, despite being a significant driver of some people’s lifetime living standards. This Resolution Foundation Report looks at what we know about taxable capital gains; how our understanding of top income shares changes if we include capital gains in our analysis; and whether definitions of income used in official statistics should be changed or supplemented.

                This IFS Briefing note uses data from HMRC’s random audit programme to show which types of people are more likely to be under-reporting taxes and how their behaviour changes after a tax audit. The results are based on data from audits covering tax returns for the years 1999–2009.

                Current UK energy use policies, which primarily aim to reduce carbon emissions, provide abatement incentives which vary by user and fuel, creating inefficiency. Distributional concerns are often given as a justification for the lower carbon price faced by households, but there is little rationale for carbon prices associated with the use of gas to be lower than those for electricity. We consider reforms that raise carbon prices faced by households, and reduce the variation in carbon prices across gas and electricity use, improving the efficiency of emissions reduction. We show that the revenue raised from this can be recycled in a way that ameliorates some of the distributional concerns. Whilst such recycling is not able to protect all poorer households, existing policy also makes distributional trade-offs, but does this in an opaque and inefficient way.

                The report analyses and assesses: the rationale and objectives of energy policy;
                the current policy landscape faced by UK energy users; how current and future
                policy has led to inconsistencies in the implicit carbon prices faced by
                different users; and potential ways in which to improve policy affecting domestic
                and business energy users.

                Government wants both to reduce carbon emissions and to reduce ‘fuel poverty’. Energy prices have risen in part because of a multitude of policies aimed at reducing emissions. There are also multiple policies aimed at ameliorating these effects. Altogether, this leads to a complex policy landscape, inefficient pricing and opaque distributional effects.<br>
                In this report, we show the effects of energy price rises over the recent past, look at what current policies mean for effective carbon prices and their impact on bills, and consider the distributional consequences of a more consistent approach to carbon pricing, alongside possible changes to the tax and benefit system that could mitigate these effects.
