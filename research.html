                In this paper we show the importance of international ties amongst the UK’s global economic elite, by exploiting administrative data derived from tax records. We show how this data can be used to shed light on the kind of transnational dynamics which have long been hypothesised to be of major significance in the UK, but which have previously proved intractable to systematic study. Our work reveals the enduring and distinctive influence of long-term imperial forces, especially to the former ‘white settler’ ex-dominions which have been called the ‘anglosphere’. These are allied to more recent currents associated with European integration and the rise of Asian economic power. Here there are especially strong ties to the ‘old EU-6’ nations of France, Germany, Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, and Italy. The incredible detail and universal coverage of our data means that we can study those at the very top with a level of granularity that would be impossible using traditional survey sources. We find compelling support for the public perception that non-doms are disproportionately highly affluent individuals who can be viewed as a part of a global elite. However, whilst there is some evidence for the stereotype of the global wealthy parking themselves in the UK, this underplays the significance of the working rich. Our analysis also reveals the remarkable concentration of non-doms in central areas of London.

                In this paper we study the contribution of migrants to the rise
                in UK top incomes. Using administrative data on the universe of
                UK taxpayers we show migrants are over-represented at the top of
                the income distribution, with migrants twice as prevalent in the
                top 0.1&percnt; as anywhere in the bottom 97&percnt; These high
                incomes are predominantly from labour, rather than capital, and
                migrants are concentrated in only a handful of industries,
                predominantly finance. Almost all (85&percnt;) of the growth in
                the UK top 1&percnt; income share over the past 20 years can be
                attributed to migration.

                We compare two approaches to measuring UK top income shares—the
                share of income going to particular subgroups, such as the top
                1%. We set out four criteria that an ideal top share series
                should satisfy: (i) comparability between numerator and
                denominator; (ii) comparability over time; (iii) international
                comparability; and (iv) practical sustainability. Our preferred
                approach meets three of these; by contrast the approach
                currently used to produce UK fiscal income series meets none of
                them. Changing to our preferred approach matters quantitatively:
                the share of income going to the top 1% is 2 percentage points
                higher, but rising more slowly, than under the alternative.

                Aggregate taxable capital gains in UK have tripled in past
                decade. Using confidential administrative data on the universe
                of UK taxpayers, we show that including gains changes the
                picture of UK inequality over the past two decades. These
                taxable gains are largely repackaged income, so their exclusion
                biases the picture of inequality. Including them changes who is
                at the top of the distribution, adding more business owners and
                older people. The share of income plus gains (both pre- and
                post-tax) going to the top 1&percnt; is 3pp higher than for
                income only, and this gap has been steadily rising.

                Poor households regularly borrow and lend to smooth consumption,
                yet we see much less borrowing for investment. This cannot be
                explained by a lack of investment opportunities, nor by a lack
                of resources available for investment. This paper provides a
                novel explanation for this puzzle: informal risk sharing can
                crowd out investment. I extend the canonical model of limited
                commitment in risk-sharing networks to allow for lumpy
                investment. The key insight is that the cost of losing insurance
                is lower for a household that has invested, since it has an
                additional stream of income. This limits its ability to credibly
                promise future transfers, and so limits its ability to borrow
                from other households. The key prediction of the model is a
                non-linear relationship between total income and investment at
                the network level – namely there is a network level poverty
                trap. I test this prediction using a randomised control trial in
                Bangladesh, that provided capital transfers to the poorest
                households. The data covers 27,000 households from 1,400
                villages, and contain information on risk-sharing networks,
                income and investment. I exploit variation in the number of
                program recipients in a network to identify the threshold level
                of capital provision needed at the network level for the program
                to move the network out of a poverty trap and generate further
                investment. I also verify additional predictions of the model
                and rule out alternative explanations. My results highlight how
                capital transfer programs can be made more cost-effective by
                targeting communities at the threshold of the aggregate poverty
                trap.

                Relatively little is known about what determines whether a
                heterogenous population ends up in a cooperative or divisive
                situation. This paper proposes a theoretical model to understand
                what social structures arise in heterogeneous populations.
                Individuals face a trade-off between cultural and economic
                incentives: an individual prefers to maintain his cultural
                practices, but doing so can inhibit interaction and economic
                exchange with those who adopt different practices. We find that
                a small minority group will adopt majority cultural practices
                and integrate. In contrast, minority groups above a certain
                critical mass, may retain diverse practices and may also
                segregate from the majority. The size of this critical mass
                depends on the cultural distance between groups, the importance
                of culture in day to day life, and the costs of forming a social
                tie. We test these predictions using data on migrants to the
                United States in the era of mass migration, and find support for
                the existence of a critical mass of migrants above which social
                structure in heterogeneous populations changes discretely
                towards cultural distinction and segregation.

                We study the effects of audits on long run compliance behaviour,
                using a random audit program covering more than 53,000 tax
                returns. We find that audits raise reported tax liabilities for
                five years after audit, effects are longer lasting for more
                stable sources of income, and only individuals found to have
                made errors respond to audit. 60-65&percnt; of revenue from
                audit comes from the change in reporting behaviour. Extending
                the standard model of rational tax evasion, we show these
                results are best explained by information revealed by audits
                constraining future misreporting. Together these imply that more
                resources should be devoted to audits, audit targeting should
                account for reporting responses, and audit threat letters miss a
                key benefit of audit

                How does economics compare to other social sciences in its study
                of issues related to race and ethnicity? We assess this using a
                corpus of 500,000 academic publications in economics, political
                science, and sociology. Using an algorithmic approach to
                classify race-related publications, we document that economics
                lags far behind the other disciplines in the volume and share of
                race-related research, despite having higher absolute volumes of
                research output. Since 1960, there have been 13,000 race-related
                publications in sociology, 4,000 in political science, and 3,000
                in economics. Since around 1970, the share of economics
                publications that are race-related has hovered just below 2%
                (although the share is higher in top-5 journals); in political
                science the share has been around 4% since the mid-1990s, while
                in sociology it has been above 6% since the 1960s and risen to
                over 12% in the last decade. Finally, using survey data
                collected from the Social Science Prediction Platform, we find
                economists tend to overestimate the amount of race-related
                research in all disciplines, but especially so in economics.

                Policymakers tend to ‘treasure what is measured’ and overlook
                phenomena that are not. In an era of increased reliance on
                administrative data, existing policies also often determine what
                is measured in the first place. We analyse this two-way
                interaction between measurement and policy in the context of the
                investment incomes and capital gains that are missing from the
                UK’s official income statistics. We show that these ‘missing
                incomes’ change the picture of economic inequality over the past
                decade, revealing rising top income shares during the period of
                austerity. The underestimation of these forms of income in
                official statistics has diverted attention from tax policies
                that disproportionately benefit the wealthiest. We urge a
                renewed focus on how policy affects and is affected by
                measurement.

                Capital gains are particularly complex to tax given their
                infrequency, the different ways in which they are generated, and
                worries about harming productivity. There are theoretical
                arguments in support of everything from zero rates to high rates
                of tax on capital. In this paper, I first discuss the impact of
                capital gains on inequality, which often motivates discussions
                about how gains should be taxed. I then set out the principles
                that determine how gains should be taxed, in particular how the
                tax rate should relate to income tax rates. I propose that
                capital gains tax rates be equalized with income tax rates,
                subject to provisions to allow gains to be ‘smoothed’ over time
                and to remove inflation from the tax base. I highlight key
                transitional issues in moving to such a tax structure. Finally,
                I discuss the specific lessons for Canada.

                This paper introduces a special issue on a Wealth Tax, which
                draws together the latest thinking on wealth taxes with the aim
                of filling this gap. It draws heavily on international
                experience and evidence, applying these insights to the UK
                context. The papers build on work undertaken for the Wealth Tax
                Commission, which delivered its final report in December 2020.
                The contributors to this special issue include tax practitioners
                and academic lawyers as well as economists, reflecting our view
                that this range of expertise is essential to evaluating the
                practice, as well as principles, of a wealth tax. In this paper
                we touch upon some common themes arising across the papers. We
                also highlight some important remaining gaps in the evidence
                base on wealth taxes, particularly on the measurement of wealth
                and behavioural responses at the very top of the wealth
                distribution.

                In this paper we model the revenue that could be raised from an
                annual and a one-off wealth tax of the design recommended by

                >. We examine the distributional effects of the tax, both in
                terms of wealth and other characteristics. We also estimate the
                share of taxpayers who would face liquidity constraints in
                meeting their tax liability. We find that an annual wealth tax
                charging 0.18&percnt; on wealth above £500,000 could generate
                £10 billion in revenue, before admin costs. Alternatively, a
                one-off tax charging 4.8&percnt; (effectively 0.96&percnt; per
                year, paid over a 5-year period) on wealth above the same
                threshold, would generate £250 billion in revenue. To put our
                revenue estimates into context, we present revenue estimates and
                costings for some commonly-proposed reforms to the existing set
                of taxes on capital.

                In this paper, we review the existing empirical evidence on how
                individuals respond to the incentives created by a net wealth
                tax. Variation in the overall magnitude of behavioural responses
                is substantial: estimates of the elasticity of taxable wealth
                vary by a factor of 800. We explore three key reasons for this
                variation: tax design, context, and methodology. We then discuss
                what is known about the importance of individual margins of
                response and how these interact with policy choices. Finally, we
                use our analysis to systematically narrow down and reconcile the
                range of elasticity estimates. We argue that a well-designed
                wealth tax would reduce the tax base (of reported wealth) by
                7-17&percnt; if levied at a tax rate of 1&percnt;.

                Household wealth is profoundly important for living standards.
                We show that wealth inequality in the UK is high and has
                increased slightly over the past decade as financial asset
                prices increased in the wake of the financial crisis. But data
                deficiencies are a major barrier in understanding the true
                distribution, composition and size of household wealth. We find
                that the most comprehensive survey of household wealth in the UK
                does a good job of capturing the vast majority of the wealth
                distribution, but that nearly &pound;800 billion of wealth held
                by the very wealthiest UK households is missing. We also find
                tentative evidence to suggest that survey measures of
                high-wealth families undervalue their assets – our central
                estimate of the true value of wealth held by households in the
                UK is 5&percnt; higher than the survey data suggests.

                We use administrative tax data from audits of self-assessment
                tax returns to understand what types individuals are most likely
                to be non-compliant. Non-compliance is common, with one-third of
                taxpayers underpaying by some amount, although half of aggregate
                under-reporting is done by just 2&percnt; of taxpayers. Third
                party reporting reduces non-compliance, while working in a
                cash-prevalent industry increases it. However, compliance also
                varies significantly with individual characteristics:
                non-compliance is higher for men and younger people. These
                results matter for measuring inequality, for understanding
                taxpayer behaviour, and for targeting audit resources.

                We consider two recent suggestions for how to perform an
                empirically motivated Monte Carlo study to help select a
                treatment effect estimator under unconfoundedness. We show
                theoretically that neither is likely to be informative except
                under restrictive conditions that are unlikely to be satisfied
                in many contexts. To test empirical relevance, we also apply the
                approaches to a real-world setting where estimator performance
                is known. Both approaches are worse than random at selecting
                estimators which minimise absolute bias. They are better when
                selecting estimators that minimise mean squared error. However,
                using a simple bootstrap is at least as good and often better.
                For now researchers would be best advised to use a range of
                estimators and compare estimates for robustness.

                Understanding whether and how connections between agents
                (networks) such as declared friendships in classrooms,
                transactions between firms, and extended family connections,
                influence their socio-economic outcomes has been a growing area
                of research within economics. Early methods developed to
                identify these <i>social effects</i> assumed that networks had
                formed exogenously, and were perfectly observed, both of which
                are unlikely to hold in practice. A more recent literature, both
                within economics and in other disciplines, develops methods that
                relax these assumptions. This paper reviews that literature. It
                starts by providing a general econometric framework for linear
                models of social effects, and illustrates how network
                endogeneity and missing data on the network complicate
                identification of social effects. Thereafter, it discusses
                methods for overcoming the problems caused by endogenous
                formation of networks. Finally, it outlines the stark
                consequences of missing data on measures of the network, and
                regression parameters, before describing potential solutions.

                are often given as a justification for the lower carbon price
                faced by households, but there is little rationale for carbon
                prices associated with the use of gas to be lower than those for
                electricity. We consider reforms that raise carbon prices faced
                by households, and reduce the variation in carbon prices across
                gas and electricity use, improving the efficiency of emissions
                reduction. We show that the revenue raised from this can be
                recycled in a way that ameliorates some of the distributional
                concerns. Whilst such recycling is not able to protect all
                poorer households, existing policy also makes distributional
                trade-offs, but does this in an opaque and inefficient way.

                In many contexts we may be interested in understanding whether
                direct connections between agents, such as declared friendships
                in a classroom or family links in a rural village, affect their
                outcomes. In this paper we review the literature studying
                econometric methods for the analysis of linear models of social
                effects, a class that includes the `linear-in-means' local
                average model, the local aggregate model, and models where
                network statistics affect outcomes. We provide an overview of
                the underlying theoretical models, before discussing conditions
                for identification using observational and
                experimental/quasi-experimental data.

                In many contexts we may be interested in understanding whether
                direct connections between agents, such as declared friendships
                in a classroom or family links in a rural village, affect their
                outcomes. In this paper we review the literature studying
                econometric methods for the analyis of social networks. We begin
                by providing a common framework for models of social effects, a
                class that includes the ‘linear-in-means’ local average model,
                the local aggregate model, and models where network statistics
                affect outcomes. We discuss identification of these models using
                both observational and experimental/quasi-experimental data. We
                then discuss models of network formation, drawing on a range of
                literatures to cover purely predictive models, reduced form
                models, and structural models, including those with a strategic
                element. Finally we discuss how one might collect data on
                networks, and the measurement error issues caused by sampling of
                networks, as well as measurement error more broadly.
