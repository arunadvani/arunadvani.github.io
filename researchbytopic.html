                We discuss the measurement of top incomes and wealth in the UK, and options for reforming their taxation. First, we highlight the importance of capital gains and migration in understanding long-term trends in top income shares, and of survey under-coverage at the top in understanding top wealth shares. We next consider the scope for reforms to the taxation of capital to tackle these inequalities, whilst also improving the efficiency of taxation, emphasising the roles of Capital Gains Tax, Inheritance Tax and Wealth Taxes. Finally, we examine the question of who is taxed, including the tax treatment of highly mobile individuals and of trusts.

                This short note summarises some key facts about non-doms, and explains the case for
                reform to the current regime. It first explains briefly what it means to be a non-dom,
                the tax advantages this can bring, the costs associated with use of these tax benefits,
                and past reforms to the regime. It then provides some key statistics on non-doms in the
                UK. Finally, we explain why the regime is in need of reform.

                This CAGE Policy Briefing studies the offshore income and capital gains of the
                UK's ‘non-doms’ – individuals who are resident in the UK but who claim on their
                tax return that their permanent home (‘domicile’) is abroad. We use de-identified
                confidential data accessed via HMRC to analyse all individuals who have claimed
                non-dom status between 1997 and 2018. We show non-doms at least £10.9 billion
                in offshore income and gains. Most of these unreported income and gains (55%)
                belong to non-doms who arrived in the UK in the past five years. Looking at
                previous reforms that restricted access to the non-dom regime, we see these led to
                very little emigration. Those who did leave were paying hardly any tax.
                Consequently, abolishing the non-dom regime would raise at least £3.2 billion even
                after accounting for migration and other tax planning, and the loss of existing
                revenue from the remittance basis charge.

                Using administrative data on the universe of UK taxpayers, we
                study the contribution of migrants to the rise in UK top incomes.
                We show migrants are over-represented at the top of the income
                distribution, with migrants twice as prevalent in the top 0.01&percnt;
                as anywhere in the bottom 97&percnt;. These high incomes are
                predominantly from labour, rather than capital, and migrants are
                concentrated in only a handful of industries, predominantly finance.
                Almost all (90&percnt;) of the observed growth in the UK top 1&percnt;
                income share over the past 20 years has accrued to migrants.

                We compare two approaches to measuring UK top income shares—the
                share of income going to particular subgroups, such as the top
                1%. We set out four criteria that an ideal top share series
                should satisfy: (i) comparability between numerator and
                denominator; (ii) comparability over time; (iii) international
                comparability; and (iv) practical sustainability. Our preferred
                approach meets three of these; by contrast the approach
                currently used to produce UK fiscal income series meets none of
                them. Changing to our preferred approach matters quantitatively:
                the share of income going to the top 1% is 2 percentage points
                higher, but rising more slowly, than under the alternative.

                Policymakers tend to ‘treasure what is measured’ and overlook
                phenomena that are not. In an era of increased reliance on
                administrative data, existing policies also often determine what
                is measured in the first place. We analyse this two-way
                interaction between measurement and policy in the context of the
                investment incomes and capital gains that are missing from the
                UK’s official income statistics. We show that these ‘missing
                incomes’ change the picture of economic inequality over the past
                decade, revealing rising top income shares during the period of
                austerity. The underestimation of these forms of income in
                official statistics has diverted attention from tax policies
                that disproportionately benefit the wealthiest. We urge a
                renewed focus on how policy affects and is affected by
                measurement.

                Top incomes have grown rapidly in recent decades and this growth
                has sparked a debate about rising inequality in Western
                societies. This column combines data from UK tax records with
                new information on migrant status to show that that migrants are
                highly represented at the top of the UK’s income distribution.
                Indeed, migration can account for the majority of top-income
                growth in the past two decades and can help explain why the UK
                has experienced an outsized increase in top incomes.

                Using anonymized administrative data on the population of UK taxpayers, we show that—in line with high-profile anecdotes about the tax affairs of the rich—effective average tax rates (EATRs) decline at the top of the distribution of income and capital gains. We also document substantial variation in EATRs within remuneration level: a quarter of those in the top 1 per cent pay headline rates, while another quarter pay at least 9pp less than the headline rate. Most of this effect is driven by the composition of remuneration, with investment income having lower tax rates and capital gains having lower rates still. If all individuals with income above £100,000 paid the headline rates, this would raise tax revenue on income and gains by £23 billion on a static basis, an increase of 27 per cent in the tax paid by this group.

                This CAGE Policy Briefing summarises new research on the taxes
                paid by the UK’s richest individuals, using anonymised data
                collected from the personal tax returns of everyone who received
                over £100,000 in total remuneration (taxable income plus taxable
                capital gains). It shows how tax paid as a share of income or
                total remuneration varies across individuals. It shows effective
                tax rates are much lower than headline rates, regressive at high
                levels of income or remuneration, and vary by up to a factor of
                five across people with the same remuneration. An
                <i>Alternative Minimum Tax</i> of 35% could raise around £11bn,
                equivalent to 2p on the basic rate or 5p on both the higher and
                additional rates.

                This CAGE Policy Briefing summarises new research on the impact
                of capital gains – which are excluded from existing income
                statistics – on measured inequality in the UK. It shows gains
                are highly concentrated, are persistent for a minority, and are
                rising. The richest have a larger share of total resources than
                previously thought, and it has been growing over time.

                Capital gains (the profits from disposing of an asset for more
                than it was worth when you acquired it) are generally excluded
                from analysis of incomes in the UK, despite being a significant
                driver of some people’s lifetime living standards. This
                Resolution Foundation Report looks at what we know about taxable
                capital gains; how our understanding of top income shares
                changes if we include capital gains in our analysis; and whether
                definitions of income used in official statistics should be
                changed or supplemented.

                Aggregate taxable capital gains in UK have tripled in past
                decade. Using confidential administrative data on the universe
                of UK taxpayers, we show that including gains changes the
                picture of UK inequality over the past two decades. These
                taxable gains are largely repackaged income, so their exclusion
                biases the picture of inequality. Including them changes who is
                at the top of the distribution, adding more business owners and
                older people. The share of income plus gains (both pre- and
                post-tax) going to the top 1&percnt; is 3pp higher than for
                income only, and this gap has been steadily rising.

                We examine how the measurement of aggregate wealth affects our understanding of wealth distribution. We explain why choices over wealth aggregates can affect the measured level and composition of wealth concentration. Applying this to the UK, we find estimates of the top 1% wealth share vary by 2.1pp – between 14.4% and 16.5% – in 2016-18, depending on the choices we make regarding aggregates and the source of distributional information. Alternative definitions for aggregates lead to a reranking of who is at the top, replacing 40% of individuals in the top 1%, and changing the share of women and older individuals. We discuss conceptual and measurement issues with the National Accounts as a source of wealth aggregates, and argue that in many cases they are poorly aligned in both regards with the measure of personal wealth one would like to target, and in practice are less comparable internationally than they initially seem. In the UK, where the wealth survey has reasonably good coverage across the distribution, we therefore prefer survey aggregates.

                This CAGE Policy Briefing studies the individuals who make up the UK's
                Sunday Times Rich List (STRL). These are the 1000 richest people or
                families with strong ties to the UK. We link together information in the
                STRL with multiple other data sources to analyse the foreign connections
                of STRL members, the industries with which they are associated, and their
                corporate ties to UK land and property. One in seven appear not to be UK
                resident for tax purposes. Among billionaires, one in seven are located
                in tax havens. Collectively they own almost £2 trillion in UK wealth.

                This report presents the final findings of the Wealth Tax
                Commission into whether the UK should have a wealth tax. It
                concludes that if the government chooses to raise taxes in
                response to COVID, it should implement a one-off wealth tax in
                preference to increasing taxes on work or consumption.

                We discuss the measurement of top incomes and wealth in the UK, and options for reforming their taxation. First, we highlight the importance of capital gains and migration in understanding long-term trends in top income shares, and of survey under-coverage at the top in understanding top wealth shares. We next consider the scope for reforms to the taxation of capital to tackle these inequalities, whilst also improving the efficiency of taxation, emphasising the roles of Capital Gains Tax, Inheritance Tax and Wealth Taxes. Finally, we examine the question of who is taxed, including the tax treatment of highly mobile individuals and of trusts.

                Household wealth is profoundly important for living standards.
                We show that wealth inequality in the UK is high and has
                increased slightly over the past decade as financial asset
                prices increased in the wake of the financial crisis. But data
                deficiencies are a major barrier in understanding the true
                distribution, composition and size of household wealth. We find
                that the most comprehensive survey of household wealth in the UK
                does a good job of capturing the vast majority of the wealth
                distribution, but that nearly &pound;800 billion of wealth held
                by the very wealthiest UK households is missing. We also find
                tentative evidence to suggest that survey measures of
                high-wealth families undervalue their assets – our central
                estimate of the true value of wealth held by households in the
                UK is 5&percnt; higher than the survey data suggests.

                In this paper we model the revenue that could be raised from an
                annual and a one-off wealth tax of the design recommended by
                <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.47445/WealthTaxFinalReport"
                  >Advani, Chamberlain and Summers (2020)</a
                >. We examine the distributional effects of the tax, both in
                terms of wealth and other characteristics. We also estimate the
                share of taxpayers who would face liquidity constraints in
                meeting their tax liability. We find that an annual wealth tax
                charging 0.18&percnt; on wealth above £500,000 could generate
                £10 billion in revenue, before admin costs. Alternatively, a
                one-off tax charging 4.8&percnt; (effectively 0.96&percnt; per
                year, paid over a 5-year period) on wealth above the same
                threshold, would generate £250 billion in revenue. To put our
                revenue estimates into context, we present revenue estimates and
                costings for some commonly-proposed reforms to the existing set
                of taxes on capital.

                This report introduces the UK Wealth Tax Commission, which will
                evaluate whether a wealth tax for the UK would be desirable and
                deliverable. To do this we have commissioned a series of
                Evidence Papers that will study each of the key issues in
                detail. In this report we set out initial evidence on what has
                been happening to wealth and wealth taxation in the UK. We
                examine the provisional case for a wealth tax, and map some of
                the difficulties in implementing it. Our intention here is not
                to provide the answers, but to illustrate the key issues this
                project will address and set out the path to our final report in
                December, which will contain our conclusions on whether or not
                the UK should have a wealth tax, and if so, how it should be
                designed.

                Partnerships do not pay an equivalent of Employer National Insurance Contributions, meaning that they face significantly lower effective tax rates on their labour costs than companies. This report argues that introducing a ‘Partnerships NICs’ would improve productivity and raise £1.9 billion per year.
                We present novel statistics on the distribution of partnership profits in the UK and discuss how much revenue could be raised from our proposed reform. Our analysis draws on pseudonymised administrative data accessed via HMRC, which provides information on all taxpayers with partnership profits in the 2020 tax year.

              <div class="pAbstract">
                In the Autumn Budget 2024, the Government announced a reform to Inheritance Tax (IHT) that reduced the reliefs available for agricultural and business property (‘APR’ and ‘BPR’). From April 2026, the first £1 million of combined qualifying agricultural and business property (the ‘combined allowance’) will continue to receive 100% relief, but above this threshold, relief will be reduced to 50%. 
                The new combined allowance of £1 million per estate is in addition to the Nil Rate Band (NRB) and Residential Nil Rate Band (RNRB) covering up to £1 million per couple. As a result of the reform, the value of farmland and business assets exceeding these allowances will face an effective tax rate of up to 20%, whereas previously these assets had been tax-free. The tax can be paid in interest-free instalments over ten years.
                The reform has proved highly controversial, especially regarding its potential impact on farmers. This report presents the first independent, evidence-based analysis of the impact of the planned reform using HMRC Inheritance Tax data. We provide a detailed impact assessment and model potential adjustments to the reform.

                ‘Carried interest’ (or ‘carry’) is one of the main forms of pay in the private equity industry. Unlike earnings, which are taxed at a top marginal rate of 47%, carried interest is currently taxed as a capital gain at the rate of 28%. The tax treatment of carried interest is highly controversial. Following the 2024 General Election, the Government reiterated its intention to ‘close the carried interest loophole’ by taxing carry like other performance-related rewards. However, it has come under significant pressure to scale back these plans following claims by industry insiders that increasing taxes on private equity executives could lead to a mass exodus of individuals and investment from the UK. Despite extensive public interest in this debate, there is virtually no statistical evidence in the public domain about how much carried interest private equity executives actually receive, how often they receive it, their demographic characteristics, how much (if any) of their own capital they put at risk in their funds, and so on. Although some high-level statistics have been released by HMRC via responses to Freedom of Information (FOI) requests, the Government does not currently publish any official statistics on carried interest or the private equity industry, and (until now) there have been no independent studies on this topic.

                ‘Carried interest’ (or ‘carry’) is one of the main forms of pay in the private equity (PE) industry. Only around 0.01% of the UK population (6,440 individuals) reported any carried interest between 2017 and 2023, but over that period their total carry exceeded £22 billion. Carried interest is extremely concentrated amongst top executives. In 2020, the top 100 executives received an average of £15 million in carry each and paid an average effective tax rate of 29% on their total income and gains (including gains on co-investments taxed at 20%). Carried interest is currently taxed as a capital gain at a rate of 28%. In June 2024, the FT quoted the then Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves as saying: ‘“I don’t think it is right that ... what is essentially a bonus is taxed at a lower rate than employment income, when you’re not putting your own capital at risk”. Since entering government, Labour has reiterated its Manifesto pledge to “take action in respect of the ‘carried interest’ loophole” by taxing carried interest like other ‘performance-related rewards’ and has said it will announce reforms in the upcoming Autumn Budget.

                Inheritance Tax (IHT) applies at a flat rate of 40% to estates worth over £325,000. This 40% rate has extremely high salience with the public and may be one of the reasons why IHT is regularly cited as the UK’s most unpopular tax. And yet, most estates do not actually pay 40% tax, or anywhere close to this. The explanation lies in the proliferation of allowances, exemptions and reliefs for IHT (referred to as ‘reliefs’ for short), which mean that the statutory tax rate is not a good guide to the effective tax rates that estates actually pay. In this report, we use de-identified tax data covering all estates filing for IHT between 2018-2020 to shed new light on IHT reliefs and their role in driving differences in effective tax rates across estates. We also evaluate whether these apparent inequities can be justified in light of other policy objectives. Finally, we discuss options for reforming IHT reliefs and provide evidence on the revenues that could be raised.

                Few UK policies have faced as turbulent a history over recent decades as Capital Gains Tax (CGT). The current CGT regime is the product of a series of contradictory reforms that have rendered the rules needlessly complex, inefficient, and unfair. Laying out a roadmap for much-need change, this report recommends a comprehensive package of CGT reforms going beyond changes to the tax rate. We use de-identified tax data accessed via His Majesty’s Revenue and Customs (HMRC) to provide estimates of the revenue and distributional impacts of these recommendations. Importantly, our policy proposals include changes to the tax base that will shut down opportunities for tax avoidance and improve investment incentives and growth. We emphasise that these measures are essential alongside any increases in the tax rate in order for CGT reform to be effective.

                Capital gains are currently taxed at much lower rates than income. This encourages individuals to work in a form that allows them to be paid in capital gains. While many small companies are highly productive, these personal service companies are typically not designed to ever grow. A negative side effect of low CGT rates is the proliferation of these businesses, which not only reduce the overall tax take, but hamper productivity by having people working in ways that are less efficient but are individually optimal because of the tax saving. We present new quantitative evidence that a large share of capital gains in the UK are, in fact, the returns to labour rather than capital. First, using a reform which aimed to make it harder to regularly pay out income as capital gains, we show at the individual level a large spike in company liquidations, as individuals attempted to benefit from CGT treatment one final time before the new rules were in place. Second, using de-identified administrative microdata from HMRC, we show at a macro level that over half of gains come from private business assets with annualised returns over 100%, suggestive that for many this money is not actually the return to capital, but to labour.

                The UK is unusual amongst international peers in not levying any tax on people who leave the country after making substantial capital gains whilst living here. We provide the first quantitative evidence on UK nationals who leave the UK after building a UK business, studying where they went and how much CGT revenue is potentially lost. We recommend that the UK should follow the approach of Australia and Canada by levying a ‘deemed disposal on departure’ (DDD) for people who leave the UK, accompanied by ‘rebasing on arrival’ (ROA) for people arriving in the UK.

                Removing the harmful distortions created by the poor design of the UK’s CGT should be a key focus of policy.  This chapter sets out how the tax base could be reformed to greatly reduce – and in some cases largely remove – the distortions to saving, investment and risk-taking. With a reformed tax base, tax rates could be increased with much less distortion to choices over whether, when or how to invest. We summarise a ‘big-picture solution’ that involves reforming the tax base while aligning overall marginal tax rates across all forms of gains and income. We also discuss steps that could be taken towards this end goal and who would win and lose from reforms.

                This briefing presents new research on the distribution of capital gains and characteristics of taxpayers who receive them. It contributes to the debate on Capital Gain Tax (CGT) reform by outlining who would be most affected by changes to this tax. We investigate this question using de-identified, confidential data accessed via HMRC, which provides information on all individuals with taxable capital gains from 1997 to 2020. 
                We show that only 3% of adults paid CGT over the decade up to 2020. Most gains go to high income individuals, with almost half going to individuals earning above £150,000. More than half of all gains go to just 5000 people - 0.01% of the population - who receive £6.8m each on average. Gains are also geographically concentrated, with more gains in Kensington than all of Wales, and more gains in Hampstead than the entire North East. Notting Hill West - a neighbourhood of 6,400 people - received more in gains over a five year period than Liverpool, Manchester and Newcastle combined.

                The IFS Green Budget Chapter looks at the effects of inheritance tax reforms on tax revenue and distributional outcomes. We begin by setting out the status quo position for inheritance tax, and the likely trends in the absence of reform. We highlight a number of problems with the current form of inheritance tax, and make recommendations for reform. We then provide static costings for these reforms, as well as for increasing or decreasing the scope of the tax. This includes the possibility of abolition. Finally we study who would benefit from these reforms, by wealth level of the person leaving the inheritance, by region of the country, and for recipients by wealth level of their parent.

                A key tenet of good policy making is use of the best available evidence. Tax is an important policy area, and one where a wealth of evidence – quantitative and qualitative analysis, and broader intelligence and insights – is generated by researchers, practitioners and officials. This report documents how different types of evidence feed into tax policy making. By highlighting the role evidence plays, and which types of evidence have an impact at different stages of the process, we aim to help external stakeholders to understand how the evidence they produce is used and how they could better feed into policy making. We also provide recommendations for how government can further shift its approach, already improved in recent years, to enhance the quality of the evidence base and to use this more effectively.

                This CAGE Policy Briefing studies the offshore income and capital gains of the
                UK's ‘non-doms’ – individuals who are resident in the UK but who claim on their
                tax return that their permanent home (‘domicile’) is abroad. We use de-identified
                confidential data accessed via HMRC to analyse all individuals who have claimed
                non-dom status between 1997 and 2018. We show non-doms at least £10.9 billion
                in offshore income and gains. Most of these unreported income and gains (55%)
                belong to non-doms who arrived in the UK in the past five years. Looking at
                previous reforms that restricted access to the non-dom regime, we see these led to
                very little emigration. Those who did leave were paying hardly any tax.
                Consequently, abolishing the non-dom regime would raise at least £3.2 billion even
                after accounting for migration and other tax planning, and the loss of existing
                revenue from the remittance basis charge.

                all were either born abroad or have lived abroad for substantial periods, and their
                incomes are very high. Non-doms are highly likely to work in finance and other ‘City’
                jobs. They tend to come from Western Europe, India and the US. Within the UK they
                largely reside in and around London, although there are sizeable shares in Oxford and

                In this paper we show the importance of international ties amongst the UK’s global economic elite, by exploiting administrative data derived from tax records. We show how this data can be used to shed light on the kind of transnational dynamics which have long been hypothesised to be of major significance in the UK, but which have previously proved intractable to systematic study. Our work reveals the enduring and distinctive influence of long-term imperial forces, especially to the former ‘white settler’ ex-dominions which have been called the ‘anglosphere’. These are allied to more recent currents associated with European integration and the rise of Asian economic power. Here there are especially strong ties to the ‘old EU-6’ nations of France, Germany, Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, and Italy. The incredible detail and universal coverage of our data means that we can study those at the very top with a level of granularity that would be impossible using traditional survey sources. We find compelling support for the public perception that non-doms are disproportionately highly affluent individuals who can be viewed as a part of a global elite. However, whilst there is some evidence for the stereotype of the global wealthy parking themselves in the UK, this underplays the significance of the working rich. Our analysis also reveals the remarkable concentration of non-doms in central areas of London.

                We discuss the measurement of top incomes and wealth in the UK, and options for reforming their taxation. First, we highlight the importance of capital gains and migration in understanding long-term trends in top income shares, and of survey under-coverage at the top in understanding top wealth shares. We next consider the scope for reforms to the taxation of capital to tackle these inequalities, whilst also improving the efficiency of taxation, emphasising the roles of Capital Gains Tax, Inheritance Tax and Wealth Taxes. Finally, we examine the question of who is taxed, including the tax treatment of highly mobile individuals and of trusts.

                Capital gains are particularly complex to tax given their
                infrequency, the different ways in which they are generated, and
                worries about harming productivity. There are theoretical
                arguments in support of everything from zero rates to high rates
                of tax on capital. In this paper, I first discuss the impact of
                capital gains on inequality, which often motivates discussions
                about how gains should be taxed. I then set out the principles
                that determine how gains should be taxed, in particular how the
                tax rate should relate to income tax rates. I propose that
                capital gains tax rates be equalized with income tax rates,
                subject to provisions to allow gains to be ‘smoothed’ over time
                and to remove inflation from the tax base. I highlight key
                transitional issues in moving to such a tax structure. Finally,
                I discuss the specific lessons for Canada.

                This CAGE Policy Briefing studies alternatives to the
                government’s new Health and Social Care Levy. Using publicly
                accessible tax data from HMRC, we find that removing the current
                National Insurance exemptions for investment income and people
                of pension age would raise £12 billion. This is the same amount
                of revenue as the Government is targeting from its new Levy.
                Equalising National Insurance on higher earnings with the rates
                already paid by lower earners could raise an additional £20
                billion. This would be enough to fund a cut in the main rate of
                NICs by 1.25p, instead of raising these rates, as the government
                is planning. Under this alternative package of reforms, more of
                the revenue would come from London and the South East, and from
                older, wealthier individuals.

                draws together the latest thinking on wealth taxes with the aim
                of filling this gap. It draws heavily on international
                experience and evidence, applying these insights to the UK
                context. The papers build on work undertaken for the Wealth Tax
                Commission, which delivered its final report in December 2020.
                The contributors to this special issue include tax practitioners
                and academic lawyers as well as economists, reflecting our view
                that this range of expertise is essential to evaluating the
                practice, as well as principles, of a wealth tax. In this paper
                we touch upon some common themes arising across the papers. We
                also highlight some important remaining gaps in the evidence
                base on wealth taxes, particularly on the measurement of wealth
                and behavioural responses at the very top of the wealth
                distribution.

                In this paper we model the revenue that could be raised from an
                annual and a one-off wealth tax of the design recommended by
                <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.47445/WealthTaxFinalReport"
                  >Advani, Chamberlain and Summers (2020)</a
                >. We examine the distributional effects of the tax, both in
                terms of wealth and other characteristics. We also estimate the
                share of taxpayers who would face liquidity constraints in
                meeting their tax liability. We find that an annual wealth tax
                charging 0.18&percnt; on wealth above £500,000 could generate
                £10 billion in revenue, before admin costs. Alternatively, a
                one-off tax charging 4.8&percnt; (effectively 0.96&percnt; per
                year, paid over a 5-year period) on wealth above the same
                threshold, would generate £250 billion in revenue. To put our
                revenue estimates into context, we present revenue estimates and
                costings for some commonly-proposed reforms to the existing set
                of taxes on capital.

                In this paper, we review the existing empirical evidence on how
                individuals respond to the incentives created by a net wealth
                tax. Variation in the overall magnitude of behavioural responses
                is substantial: estimates of the elasticity of taxable wealth
                vary by a factor of 800. We explore three key reasons for this
                variation: tax design, context, and methodology. We then discuss
                what is known about the importance of individual margins of
                response and how these interact with policy choices. Finally, we
                use our analysis to systematically narrow down and reconcile the
                range of elasticity estimates. We argue that a well-designed
                wealth tax would reduce the tax base (of reported wealth) by
                7-17&percnt; if levied at a tax rate of 1&percnt;.

                Aggregate taxable capital gains in UK have tripled in past
                decade. Using confidential administrative data on the universe
                of UK taxpayers, we show that including gains changes the
                picture of UK inequality over the past two decades. These
                taxable gains are largely repackaged income, so their exclusion
                biases the picture of inequality. Including them changes who is
                at the top of the distribution, adding more buiness owners and
                older people. The share of income plus gains (both pre- and
                post-tax) going to the top 1&percnt; is 3pp higher than for
                income only, and this gap has been steadily rising.

                The Register of Overseas Entities (ROE) was introduced by the government in Spring 2022 with the commitment that it would “require anonymous foreign owners of UK property to reveal their real identities”. We use data released by Companies House and HM Land Registry to assess to what extent the ROE is currently delivering on this aim. We identify and quantify several major ‘gaps’ in the scope and operation of the register and make recommendations for how the register could be improved.

                We study the effects of audits on long run compliance behaviour,
                using a random audit program covering more than 53,000 tax
                returns. We find that audits raise reported tax liabilities for
                five years after audit, effects are longer lasting for more
                stable sources of income, and only individuals found to have
                made errors respond to audit. 60-65&percnt; of revenue from
                audit comes from the change in reporting behaviour. Extending
                the standard model of rational tax evasion, we show these
                results are best explained by information revealed by audits
                constraining future misreporting. Together these imply that more
                resources should be devoted to audits, audit targeting should
                account for reporting responses, and audit threat letters miss a
                key benefit of audit

                We use administrative tax data from audits of self-assessment
                tax returns to understand what types individuals are most likely
                to be non-compliant. Non-compliance is common, with one-third of
                taxpayers underpaying by some amount, although half of aggregate
                under-reporting is done by just 2&percnt; of taxpayers. Third
                party reporting reduces non-compliance, while working in a
                cash-prevalent industry increases it. However, compliance also
                varies significantly with individual characteristics:
                non-compliance is higher for men and younger people. These
                results matter for measuring inequality, for understanding
                taxpayer behaviour, and for targeting audit resources.

                Using administrative data on the globally connected super-rich in the UK, we study the effect of a large tax reform on migration behaviour.  Prior to 2017, offshore investment returns for `non-doms' – individuals tax-resident in the UK but with connections to other countries – were untaxed.  People making use of that tax status are strongly concentrated at the top of the income distribution: 86% are in the UK top 1% and 29% in the top 0.1% once overseas investment income is taken into account. A reform in 2017 brought long-stayers, who had been in the UK for at least 15 of the last 20 years, into the standard tax system, reducing their effective net-of-average-tax rate by 18%.  We find that emigration responses were modest: our central estimate is that the emigration rate increases by 0.26 percentage points for a 1% decline in the net-of-tax rate, and we can rule out increases larger than 0.4 percentage points. Dispelling fears that the targeted taxpayers were able to circumvent the tax hike, we find large average increases in income reported and tax paid in the UK of more than 150%.

                In this paper we study the contribution of migrants to the rise
                in UK top incomes. Using administrative data on the universe of
                UK taxpayers we show migrants are over-represented at the top of
                the income distribution, with migrants twice as prevalent in the
                top 0.1&percnt; as anywhere in the bottom 97&percnt; These high
                incomes are predominantly from labour, rather than capital, and
                migrants are concentrated in only a handful of industries,
                predominantly finance. Almost all (85&percnt;) of the growth in
                the UK top 1&percnt; income share over the past 20 years can be
                attributed to migration.

                Top incomes have grown rapidly in recent decades and this growth
                has sparked a debate about rising inequality in Western
                societies. This column combines data from UK tax records with
                new information on migrant status to show that that migrants are
                highly represented at the top of the UK’s income distribution.
                Indeed, migration can account for the majority of top-income
                growth in the past two decades and can help explain why the UK
                has experienced an outsized increase in top incomes.

                An established literature has studied potential biases in the economics publication process based on traits of authors. We complement such work by studying whether the subject matter of study relates to publication outcomes. We do so in the context of race-related research: work that studies economic well-being across racial/ethnic groups. We investigate the implicit career incentives economists have to work on such topics by examining paths to publication for a corpus of 22,056 NBER working papers (WPs) posted from 1974 to 2015. We use an algorithm to classify whether a given WP studies race-related issues. We then construct paths to publication from WPs to data on published articles, and compare paths for race-related WPs to various counterfactual sets of WPs. We document that unconditionally, race-related NBER WPs are less likely to be published in any journal, in an economics journal, and more likely to publish in lower tier economics journals. Once we condition on observable characteristics including field and author affiliations, differences in paths to publication largely disappear, and such work is actually slightly more likely to publish in top-tier economics journals. Consistent with unconditional differences in paths to publication being salient to researchers, we find evidence of ex ante selection into WPs studying race-related issues in that they are of higher readability than other WPs. To understand the interplay with selection of researchers, we compare results to paths to publications for 10,306 CEPR WPs posted from 1984 to 2015. We conclude by discussing implications for economists' incentives to contribute to debates on race and ethnicity in the economy.

                Issues of racial justice and economic inequalities between racial and ethnic groups have risen to the top of public debate. Economists’ ability to contribute to these debates is based on the body of race-related research. We study the volume and content of race-related research in economics. We base our analysis on a corpus of 225,000 economics publications from 1960 to 2020 to which we apply an algorithmic approach to classify race-related work. We present three new facts. First, since 1960 less than 2% of economics publications have been race-related. There is an uptick in such work in the mid 1990s. Among the top-5 journals this is driven by the <i>American Economic Review</i>, <i>Quarterly Journal of Economics</i> and the <i>Journal of Political Economy</i>. <i>Econometrica</i> and the <i>Review of Economic Studies</i> have each cumulatively published fewer than 15 race-related articles since 1960. Second, on content, while over 50% of race-related publications in the 1970s focused on Black individuals, by the 2010s this had fallen to 20%. There has been a steady decline in the share of race-related research on discrimination since the 1980s, with a rise in the share of studies on identity. Finally, we apply our algorithm to NBER and CEPR working papers posted over the last four decades, to study an earlier stage of the research process. We document a balkanization of race-related research into a few fields, and its continued absence from many others – a result that holds even within the subset of research examining issues of inequality or diversity. We discuss implications of our findings for economists’ ability to contribute to debates on race and ethnicity in the economy.

                How does economics compare to other social sciences in its study
                of issues related to race and ethnicity? We assess this using a
                corpus of 500,000 academic publications in economics, political
                science, and sociology. Using an algorithmic approach to
                classify race-related publications, we document that economics
                lags far behind the other disciplines in the volume and share of
                race-related research, despite having higher absolute volumes of
                research output. Since 1960, there have been 13,000 race-related
                publications in sociology, 4,000 in political science, and 3,000
                in economics. Since around 1970, the share of economics
                publications that are race-related has hovered just below 2%
                (although the share is higher in top-5 journals); in political
                science the share has been around 4% since the mid-1990s, while
                in sociology it has been above 6% since the 1960s and risen to
                over 12% in the last decade. Finally, using survey data
                collected from the Social Science Prediction Platform, we find
                economists tend to overestimate the amount of race-related
                research in all disciplines, but especially so in economics.

                In the wake of last summer’s Black Lives Matter protests, many
                have asked themselves what they are doing to tackle racial
                injustice. For economists, one central question is the extent to
                which the profession has examined the causes and consequences of
                racial inequality. This column reports evidence that
                race-related research in economic journals constitutes a far
                lower share than in comparable publications in sociology and
                political science. What’s more, economists over-estimate the
                extent of race-related research done by the profession.
                Understanding why economists produce so little race-related
                research is essential if the discipline is going to be able to
                reform.

                Economists are central to policymaking in the UK, and to
                providing the research that underpins that policymaking. Despite
                having this important role in society, economists are not very
                representative of society, with a well-documented
                under-representation of women in the profession. In this
                briefing note, we examine the ethnic diversity of academic
                economists who provide much of the research that ultimately
                feeds into policymaking. We use data from the Higher Education
                Statistics Agency (HESA) to look at which groups are more or
                less well represented as academic economic researchers. We then
                examine economics students, to understand both the source of
                current under-representation and the prospects for change.
                Finally, we study some of the barriers faced by economics
                students. We are not able to examine diversity among the large
                number of economists who work outside academia, due to a lack of
                data.

                The future of UK economics is looking predominantly male and
                disproportionately privately educated. This column introduces
                <i>#DiscoverEconomics</i> – a campaign to increase diversity in
                economics led by the Royal Economic Society and with the support
                of a wide range of institutions involved in economic research,
                communication and policymaking, including the Bank of England,
                the Government Economic Service, the Society of Professional
                Economists and many leading research institutions. The campaign
                aims to attract more women, ethnic minority students, and
                students from state schools and colleges to study the subject at
                university.

                The gender pay gap opens up immediately after graduation, with
                male graduates earning 5% more than female graduates on average
                at age 25. Ten years after graduation – before most graduates
                start having children – the gender pay gap stands at 25%. Most
                of the initial gap can be explained by university subject choices,
                with women less likely to study subjects that lead to high-paying
                jobs: women make up just a third of graduates in economics, the
                subject with the highest financial returns, and two thirds of
                graduates in creative arts, the subject with the lowest returns.
                Subject choice continues contribute to the gender pay gap over
                time, but its relative importance fades as other factors (like
                having children and working part-time) come into play.

                The economics profession – and the current student population
                studying economics – is not representative of society, with
                women, some ethnic minorities, and state school students
                underrepresented. While more than 7% of private school boys
                doing an undergraduate degree were studying economics in
                2018/19, less than 1% of state school girls were. We highlight
                that interventions aimed at changing this picture need to
                consider the choices students make early on in their educational
                career. A Level Economics is a key gateway to further study in
                the subject, but access to and take-up of this qualification
                varies substantially according to a student’s background. As a
                result, improving representation within the economics profession
                in the long-term must include steps to ensure young students
                understand what the subject involves and the opportunities it
                provides, and have the chance to study it before university.

                  The future of UK economics is looking predominantly male and
                  disproportionately privately educated. This column introduces
                  <i>#DiscoverEconomics</i> – a campaign to increase diversity
                  in economics led by the Royal Economic Society and with the
                  support of a wide range of institutions involved in economic
                  research, communication and policymaking, including the Bank
                  of England, the Government Economic Service, the Society of
                  Professional Economists and many leading research
                  institutions. The campaign aims to attract more women, ethnic
                  minority students, and students from state schools and
                  colleges to study the subject at university.

                Current UK energy use policies, which primarily aim to reduce
                carbon emissions, provide abatement incentives which vary by
                user and fuel, creating inefficiency. Distributional concerns
                are often given as a justification for the lower carbon price
                faced by households, but there is little rationale for carbon
                prices associated with the use of gas to be lower than those for
                electricity. We consider reforms that raise carbon prices faced
                by households, and reduce the variation in carbon prices across
                gas and electricity use, improving the efficiency of emissions
                reduction. We show that the revenue raised from this can be
                recycled in a way that ameliorates some of the distributional
                concerns. Whilst such recycling is not able to protect all
                poorer households, existing policy also makes distributional
                trade-offs, but does this in an opaque and inefficient way.

                Government wants both to reduce carbon emissions and to reduce
                ‘fuel poverty’. Energy prices have risen in part because of a
                multitude of policies aimed at reducing emissions. There are
                also multiple policies aimed at ameliorating these effects.
                Altogether, this leads to a complex policy landscape,
                inefficient pricing and opaque distributional effects.<br />
                In this report, we show the effects of energy price rises over
                the recent past, look at what current policies mean for
                effective carbon prices and their impact on bills, and consider
                the distributional consequences of a more consistent approach to
                carbon pricing, alongside possible changes to the tax and
                benefit system that could mitigate these effects.

                Poor households regularly borrow and lend to smooth consumption,
                yet we see much less borrowing for investment. This cannot be
                explained by a lack of investment opportunities, nor by a lack
                of resources available for investment. This paper provides a
                novel explanation for this puzzle: informal risk sharing can
                crowd out investment. I extend the canonical model of limited
                commitment in risk-sharing networks to allow for lumpy
                investment. The key insight is that the cost of losing insurance
                is lower for a household that has invested, since it has an
                additional stream of income. This limits its ability to credibly
                promise future transfers, and so limits its ability to borrow
                from other households. The key prediction of the model is a
                non-linear relationship between total income and investment at
                the network level – namely there is a network level poverty
                trap. I test this prediction using a randomised control trial in
                Bangladesh, that provided capital transfers to the poorest
                households. The data covers 27,000 households from 1,400
                villages, and contain information on risk-sharing networks,
                income and investment. I exploit variation in the number of
                program recipients in a network to identify the threshold level
                of capital provision needed at the network level for the program
                to move the network out of a poverty trap and generate further
                investment. I also verify additional predictions of the model
                and rule out alternative explanations. My results highlight how
                capital transfer programs can be made more cost-effective by
                targeting communities at the threshold of the aggregate poverty
                trap.

                We consider two recent suggestions for how to perform an
                empirically motivated Monte Carlo study to help select a
                treatment effect estimator under unconfoundedness. We show
                theoretically that neither is likely to be informative except
                under restrictive conditions that are unlikely to be satisfied
                in many contexts. To test empirical relevance, we also apply the
                approaches to a real-world setting where estimator performance
                is known. Both approaches are worse than random at selecting
                estimators which minimise absolute bias. They are better when
                selecting estimators that minimise mean squared error. However,
                using a simple bootstrap is at least as good and often better.
                For now researchers would be best advised to use a range of
                estimators and compare estimates for robustness.

                Understanding whether and how connections between agents
                (networks) such as declared friendships in classrooms,
                transactions between firms, and extended family connections,
                influence their socio-economic outcomes has been a growing area
                of research within economics. Early methods developed to
                identify these <i>social effects</i> assumed that networks had
                formed exogenously, and were perfectly observed, both of which
                are unlikely to hold in practice. A more recent literature, both
                within economics and in other disciplines, develops methods that
                relax these assumptions. This paper reviews that literature. It
                starts by providing a general econometric framework for linear
                models of social effects, and illustrates how network
                endogeneity and missing data on the network complicate
                identification of social effects. Thereafter, it discusses
                methods for overcoming the problems caused by endogenous
                formation of networks. Finally, it outlines the stark
                consequences of missing data on measures of the network, and
                regression parameters, before describing potential solutions.

                In many contexts we may be interested in understanding whether
                direct connections between agents, such as declared friendships

                the underlying theoretical models, before discussing conditions
                for identification using observational and

                In many contexts we may be interested in understanding whether
                direct connections between agents, such as declared friendships
                in a classroom or family links in a rural village, affect their

                econometric methods for the analyis of social networks. We begin
                by providing a common framework for models of social effects, a
                class that includes the ‘linear-in-means’ local average model,
                the local aggregate model, and models where network statistics
                affect outcomes. We discuss identification of these models using
                both observational and experimental/quasi-experimental data. We
                then discuss models of network formation, drawing on a range of
                literatures to cover purely predictive models, reduced form
                models, and structural models, including those with a strategic
                element. Finally we discuss how one might collect data on
                networks, and the measurement error issues caused by sampling of
                networks, as well as measurement error more broadly.
