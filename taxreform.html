                <i>Notes:</i><br>
                1. Figures in the table are based originally on the Evidence papers linked. 
                They have been uprated from the original calculation year by the growth in GDP (or forecast GDP for "five years time").
                If existing trends continue, this is likely to underestimate the revenue raised, since these taxes are based on private wealth, which has been growing faster than GDP over the past few decades. Indeed, over the period that we can observe, growth in capital gains (for example) has substantially exceeded the growth rate of GDP.
                <br>
                2. Revenue estimates are, currently, a mix of "static" and "post-behavioural" calculations. Non-dom reform accounts for behavioural responses. This <a href="http://taxsimulator.ukwealth.tax">wealth tax simulator</a> provides more detailed, post-behavioural calculations for an annual wealth tax. Other reforms currently don't account for behavioural responses. This simulator will expand to account for more reforms and more responses over time. <br> 
                3. Tax interactions are incomplete. The simulator currently accounts for the effects any reform to the structure of National Insurance Contributions on other reforms to National Insurance Contributions. It also accounts for changes to National Insurance Contributions and Capital Gains Tax on the revenue raised from non-doms. However, other taxes interactions are not currently accounted for. For example, the introduction of an Annual Wealth Tax would also affect the revenue from non-doms. <br> 
                4. This simulator was launched in Nov 2022. In Oct 2023 it was updated to reflect (a) GDP growth to date; (b) additional evidence for Inheritance Tax; (c) removal of the reform to the 45p tax rate, since this reform was actually implemented. <br>
