                1. Figures in the table are based originally on the Evidence papers linked. 
                They have been uprated by the growth in GDP (or forecast GDP for "five years time").
                If existing trends continue, this is likely to underestimate the revenue raised, since these taxes are based on private wealth, which has been growing faster than GDP over the past few decades. Indeed, over the period that we can observe, growth in capital gains (for example) has substantially exceeded the growth rate of GDP.
                <br>
                2. Revenue estimates are, with the exception of the annual wealth tax and non-dom reform, static calculations.
