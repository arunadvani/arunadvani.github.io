              <div class="pAbstract">
                In the UK, work is taxed more heavily than wealth. Someone working on minimum wage will pay Income Tax at 20%, employee National Insurance Contributions at 13.25%, and have their employer pay employer National Insurance Contributions of 15% of their earnings (which ultimately holds down wages). They will then go home and pay rent to a landlord who pays neither employer nor employee National Insurance Contributions. The owner of the company they work for will receive payment in dividends, which have a lower Income Tax rate, and - even after accounting for Corporation Tax - they will pay a lower rate than someone receiving the equivalent income from work.<br>
                <br>
                The status quo is unfair. Not only because those with the 'broadest shoulders' are precisely those who have income that is taxed at these lower rates. But also because, among those with similar incomes, it leads to huge disparities in the tax paid. Whether the rich should pay a lot or a little is a matter of taste, and there is disagreement over what "a lot" or "little" might mean, but it is hard to argue that they should pay different amounts depending how they are able to structure their income.<br>
                <br>
                The status quo is damaging to growth. By creating these difference in tax rates depending on the structure of income, it encourages people to do things just to save tax. Fantastic employees quit successful jobs to become mediocre managers of their own company, doing otherwise the same work but having to deal with extra paperwork, just because this is tax privileged. If you can get the initial capital, being a landlord is a particularly low tax way to get an income. This isn't a system designed to encourage investment in productive things, or to have people matched to the type of work that they would be best at.<br>
                <br>
                The status quo is hugely expensive. There is a myth that the only serious ways to raise tax revenue in the UK are to increase Income Tax, National Insurance Contributions, or VAT. This is false. It is the case that these raise the biggest sums of money. And there are no obvious alternative revenue sources that could replace any of these. But starting from the status quo, substantial revenue can be raised from taxing wealth better. The calculator below shows what could be raised from reforming the taxation of wealth, and the table provides more details on the reform proposal and links for further reading. <br>

                1. Figures in the table are based originally on the Evidence papers linked. 
                They have been uprated from the original calculation year by the growth in GDP (or forecast GDP for "five years time").
                If existing trends continue, this is likely to underestimate the revenue raised, since these taxes are based on private wealth, which has been growing faster than GDP over the past few decades. Indeed, over the period that we can observe, growth in capital gains (for example) has substantially exceeded the growth rate of GDP.
                <br>
                2. Revenue estimates are, currently, a mix of "static" and "post-behavioural" calculations. Non-dom reform accounts for behavioural responses. This <a href="http://taxsimulator.ukwealth.tax">wealth tax simulator</a> provides more detailed, post-behavioural calculations for an annual wealth tax. Other reforms currently don't account for behavioural responses. This simulator will expand to account for more reforms and more responses over time. <br> 
                3. Tax interactions are incomplete. The simulator currently accounts for the effects any reform to the structure of National Insurance Contributions on other reforms to National Insurance Contributions. It also accounts for changes to National Insurance Contributions and Capital Gains Tax on the revenue raised from non-doms. However, other taxes interactions are not currently accounted for. For example, the introduction of an Annual Wealth Tax would also affect the revenue from non-doms. <br>
